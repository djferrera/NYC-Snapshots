# NYC-Snapshots
Analysis and Visualizations for NYC Pluto Data + IRS Data + 311 Data

Analyzed multiple data sets using a combination of Excel, Python and Tableau to create a variety of New York City snapshots. Each data set came with its own limitations and challenges. New York City's PLUTO data gets skewed when viewing by zip code, as one Midtown Manhattan zip code encompasses a much smaller area than one Staten Island zip code. Similarly, it is difficult to accurately capture the area of land devoted to parks and recreation when that square footage is compared to the total buildable square footage (meaning every floor) of every structure within the five boroughs.... square footage that can run into the trillions depending on what data you are focused on. The IRS data was somewhat more straightforward but less robust. The city's 311 data was difficult to organize as requests where wide ranging and did not always neatly fall into categories.
